# Folder Description
* This will contain all of the files you extract from your Avionics.
* Generally, files are listed in order of recording. (Ex. 00000001.BIN is the oldest file recorded and the number will increment with each additional file)
* Be careful if you have existing data while trying to download additional BIN files, if they have the same name you will run into the potential of overwriting old files
* A good step is to immediatly rename your launch files after downloading them. If you can identify which file corresponds to the date and launch number you could name them in a method such as (Date)_SSR_(Launch Number)
	* Example: The Second launch of the day on November 3rd, 2023 could be written as 231103_SSR_L2
